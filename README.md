### VR Editor Tools for Unity and Unreal

[Unity's EditorXR Github Page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EditorXR)

[Google Doc with EditorXR Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RD0SAjWnXdtY6eOC4qHk_fcl7w2-aBGrF3rX5pk5KDo/edit)

Installation for EditorXR is confusing. Currently, use 2018.3 rather than 2019, make sure Text Mesh Pro and Text Mesh Pro Essentials are installed.

Get the EditorXR Package link, prior version of the SteamVR plugin (if using Vive) and the Oculus Utilities for Unity (if using Oculus) from the document above and install the plugins.

Once you've installed the packages, re-import OpenVR via the Package Manager.

To view your scene in VR, **do not** use the VR Camera Rig included with either the SteamVR Plugin or with Oculus. Instead just use a totally normal Unity camera in your scene.
